= Sherlock and MiniMax

Watson gives Sherlock an array A~1~,A~2~...A~N~.

He asks him to find an integer M between P and Q(both inclusive), such that, min {|A~i~-M|, 1 ≤ i ≤ N} is maximised. If there are multiple solutions, print the smallest one.

== Input Format
The first line contains N. The next line contains space separated N integers, and denote the array A. The third line contains two space separated integers denoting P and Q.

== Constraints

|===
|1 ≤ N ≤ 102
|1 ≤ A~i~ ≤ 109
|1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ 109
|===

== Output Format
In one line, print the required answer.

== Sample Input
3 +
5 8 14 +
4 9 +

== Sample Output
4

== Explanation
For M = 4,6,7, or 9, the result is 1. Since we have to output the smallest of the multiple solutions, we print 4.
